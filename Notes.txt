Notes:

Goal: To create a IoT sensor network around the world, capturing and visualizing water quality levels.

Target: Public utility companies
Sensor: Arduino with Water quality sensor and GPS module
REST API for data transactions
Firebase for persistence
Frontend: Some web application with Google Maps with points to sensor stations
Analysis: See Grundfos data, maybe mock it

Use cases: Find the water quality around the world, capture data - for prediction, forecasting, modelling
