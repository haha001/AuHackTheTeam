Hold a water bottle



Hi, my name is Simon

As we all know, today there is 750 MILLION people (around the world) without clean water. This is a huge problem that spreads diseases and limits quality of life.

We are here to present you with a solution that will help these people better their lives.

Our solution is to use sensor technology connected with smartphones around the world to notify people about clean water using the World Health Organization's index on quality of water.

Using this approach also enables us to implement machine learning so that we could predict how the quality of water changes, and therefore, potentially prevent unnecessary death.

If you add technologies such as the Google Maps API, Firebase and IoT technologies, we can create a platform for other organizations to accellerate their progress in creating a better world.

I feel very grateful to be able to hold this bottle of clean water in my hand, let's take that feeling to everybody. 

Thank you very much for listening.
